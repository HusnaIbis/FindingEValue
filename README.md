# Finding e Value with Monte Carlo Simulation and Multithreading
###### Monte Carlo Simulation predicts a result set based on an estimated range of values against a set of fixed input values. Monte Carlo Simulations are also used in long-term forecasting due to their accuracy. The larger the number of entries, the larger the number of predictions.
###### Single threaded processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. In other words, one command is processes at a time. The opposite of single threaded processes are multithreaded processes. These processes allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. In Finding e value example, you can see the difference of singlethreading and multithreading.
